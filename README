USAGE
======================
To compile:
	user$>make

To run:
	user$>./threaded [config_file] [output_filename]
	  OR
	user$>./unthreaded [config_file] [output_filename]

The executable "threaded" and "unthreaded" differ exactly how their names imply; "threaded" is a threaded version of "unthreaded."

If config_file is not specified, template.txt is used. If output_filename is given, the state of the network at the end of all calculations is output to output_filename as a "defined" type network.
